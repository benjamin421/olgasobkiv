                What to Consider: Study Masters in Architecture in the US or UK?
              </h2>
              <p>
                I am writing this article because in retrospect I would have
                benefitted from some extra guidance regarding the above noted
                question. When I was researching this question there where no
                good sources that clearly outlined a decision making framework.
              </p>
              <p>
                A little bit of background about me: I completed my Bachelor of
                Science in Architecture at Washington University in St. Louis,
                graduating in 2021. I was interested in the prospect of studying
                my Masters in Architecture in the UK for a while. After my first
                year of Undergraduate studies I came across the Bartlett School
                of Architecture through their Instagram. I visited London that
                summer briefly for 3 days and after that the Bartlett was set as
                a reach goal. I started to research the logistics regarding
                study in the UK at the beginning of my fourth and final year at
                WashU. There was no clear definitive resource online to give me
                conclusive answers so I reached out to several alumni, and read
                over both the US and UK architecture registration board
                websites. My conclusion was that a year out working would be
                required for me to have a chance at getting into UK architecture
                Masters programs. It was worded as ‘Not mandatory but highly
                encouraged’. Ultimately, I decided to apply to three schools in
                the US (Columbia, RICE, Harvard) and two in the UK (AA and the
                Bartlett). In the end it was a toss-up between RICE and the
                Bartlett, the US or the UK. My final decision was to venture to
                the UK. Soon enough I was in the UK and starting classes in the
                Bartlett. The Masters in Architecture program in the UK is a
                two-year program, each year consisting of 3-terms. After
                completing my first of three terms I decided to take an
                interruption. An interruption means that I currently have until
                the summer to decide whether or not I will be returning to the
                Bartlett next year. It was not an easy decision and hence I am
                now writing this blog to serve as a helpful resource to others
                considering a similar path. *In this article please keep in mind
                that I am assuming that you are in a similar position to myself
                where you have already completed your undergraduate in the US.
                <br />
                It is important to firstly understand that the US and the UK
                have a different process for becoming a registered architect.
                Therefore, if you are trying to decide whether or not this is a
                good idea for you, I would first and foremost ask whether
                getting licensed as architect is ultimately your end goal. If
                so, then ask yourself where you most principally want to
                practice? For me, which I will elaborate on a little farther
                down in this post, this was a large deciding factor for my
                interruption. If yes and to hold a license in the US, then I
                would highly recommend completing your Masters at a NCARB
                accredited US university and looking for opportunities abroad
                farther down the line in your career. If yes and you are not
                opposed to being a registered architect principally in the UK
                than this is a great route to doing so. If you don’t see
                yourself getting registered as an architect and see this more as
                a two-year adventure for a Masters in London then why not!
                London is a fantastic city to grow both professionally and
                personally, and if it weren’t for the realization that I may not
                be able to get licensed in the US I would likely still be there.
                I will now share with you an anecdote regarding a Bosnian lawyer
                that helped me come to this realization.
              </p>
              <p>
                Bosnian Lawyer: My friends all went to law school in the US.
                <br />
                My friend: Why did you decide to study in the UK? <br />
                Bosnian Lawyer: I wanted to be different. <br />
                My friend: And…? <br />
                Bosnian Lawyer: I am still in the UK. <br />
                If this is as far as you read, then your one main takeaway
                should be that by studying your Masters in the UK does make your
                path to licensure in the US (if you want this as an available
                option) unnecessarily difficult, if not impossible. I don’t
                doubt that it is possible to eventually figure something out but
                there will 100% be many hoops to hop through in order to make it
                work. Not to mention, that the way the new reciprocity agreement
                between the US and UK has been announced would make it easier
                for you to first get licensed in the US and then get reciprocity
                in the UK rather than vice versa. To understand what I mean by
                this it helpful to understand the differences between the US and
                UK architecture licensure process if you are not yet familiar.
              </p>

              <h3>Getting Licensed in the UK</h3>
              <p>
                If you study or practice architecture in the UK than you will
                quickly become familiar with the ARB and RIBA. The ARB
                (Architects Registration Board) is the principle body in the UK
                regulating the registration of qualified ‘Architects’. RIBA
                (Royal Institute of British Architects) is conversely a
                noncompulsory but recommended organization that already
                registered architects join. Therefore, the ARB is the sole body
                responsible for the registration of architects whilst RIBA could
                be viewed as akin to the AIA, promoting continued education and
                high professional standards within architecture. The ARB has a
                three-part system to licensure which I outlined below. Although
                all of the core elements are the same - education, experience,
                and examination - the order in which they must be completed does
                differ significantly. <br />
                Part I: Undergraduate degree (3 years). Here is the RIBA list of
                validated schools and courses. Completing a RIBA validated
                course means means you automatically gain the Part I
                qualification when you graduate and forgo Part I examination.
                Part I: Professional Experience (1 Year). You’re expected to do
                is find a job in architecture for 1 year. Although this is not a
                rigid requirement many Masters degree programmes stipulate in
                their entry requirements. During your years of experience you
                are required to fill in records of your professional activities
                known as PEDRs (Professional Experience and Development Record).
                This is done through the RIBA here. <br />
                Part II: Masters Degree (2 Years). As with Part 1, validated
                courses give you exemption from the RIBA Part 2 Examination and
                give you automatic Part 2 qualification upon completion of your
                Masters degree. <br />
                Part II Professional Experience/ Part III Examination (1 Year):
                Complete the last 12 months of the total 24 required before you
                can take the Part 3 Examination. The whole exam process isn’t
                just a single exam, it’s made up of different bits, including
                among other things your completed PEDRs, a case study of a
                project you have lead, an interview, and a written exam.
              </p>

              <h3>Getting Licensed in the US</h3>
              <p>
                The US licensure process is similar, however it is not
                categorized into the 3-part system like the UK. Each of the 55
                U.S. states set their own requirements for licensure that all
                include three core components - education, experience, and
                examination. If you are looking to get licensed in the US you
                should be familiar with the following terms - NAAB, AIA, NCARB,
                AXP, and ARE. The National Architectural Accrediting Board
                (NAAB) A degree from a NAAB-accredited school meets the
                education requirement to get certified by the National Council
                of Architectural Registration Boards (NCARB).
                NCARB-certification makes it easier to get licensed in other
                states, so you can work anywhere. Therefore NCARB is analogous
                to the ARB in the UK. The American Institute of Architects (AIA)
                is similar to the RIBA. The Architecture Experience Program
                (AXP) regulates the experience requirements for registered
                architects and the Architect Registration Examination (ARE) is
                the regulated examination. NCARB outlines the following
                requirements to Earn Your Architecture License. <br />
                Earn an architecture degree from an NAAB-accredited program, or
                meet education requirements of your jurisdiction. <br />
                Gain and document the required experience. All 55 U.S.
                jurisdictions accept the AXP (Architectural Experience Program)
                but some require additional experience. Experience is recoded
                through an NCARB record with a specified breakdown of hours.
                <br />
                Pass the ARE. required by all 55 jurisdictions. <br />
                Meet any additional juridical requirements. Some boards require
                additional experience or a location-specific supplemental exam
                before licensure. <br />
                Have your NCARB Record transmitted to the jurisdiction where you
                would like to be licensed. Your NCARB Record is a verified
                account of your professional history that demonstrates your
                qualifications for licensure
              </p>

              <h3>
                Why you may need to reconsider your decision to study your
                Master’s in the UK?
              </h3>
              <p>
                The similarities between the US and the UK architecture
                education and licensure systems can be deceiving. My own
                conclusion was , “they are similar enough that I can surely make
                it work.” However, there are some very clear hoops and hurdles
                that you should be aware of prior to making your decision.
                <br />
                Firstly, if you are in the same position as myself and have
                completed your Bachelor’s of Science in Architecture (or
                similar) at a US University, you will need to get Part 1
                equivalence in the UK. Do note that if you choose to go down
                this route the prescribed exam will cost you at least £1950.00.
                I myself have not yet taken the Prescribed Examination so I
                cannot attest to the ease or difficulty of this process but if
                you want to read more about ARB Prescribed Exams for those who
                hold overseas or non-recognized UK qualifications here. Also,
                please note that you don’t have to get Part I Prescribed
                Equivalence to apply for the Master’s Program. It is in your
                best interest to get Part I equivalence through the prescribed
                exam as soon as you reasonably can once you are in the UK.
                <br />
                Secondly, Architects should soon have increased freedom
                practicing between the US and UK. You can read more about the
                reciprocity agreement between the US and UK here. However, my
                conclusion is that getting licensed in the US and then receiving
                reciprocity in the UK is more advantageous and more easily
                attainable than vice-versa. The United States and United Kingdom
                ratified a reciprocity agreement for architects in June. The
                agreement won’t be in-effect until early in 2023 because the ARB
                must first review, approve and sign the agreement before it goes
                into effect.
                <br />
                However, it is key to note that this reciprocity agreement is
                only for architects that followed the ‘standard’ path to
                licensure in either the US or the UK. In the US this would mean
                that you would have to have an architecture degree from a
                NAAB-accredited program. Therefore, if your hope was to complete
                your masters in the UK and then get licensed via the EESA path,
                according to the information currently announced regarding
                reciprocity, you likely won’t qualify. <br />
                The standard path to licensure in the UK, as I understand it,
                would also require that all three parts - Part I, Part II, and
                Part III - had been completed in the UK. Therefore, getting Part
                I equivalence via the ARB Prescribed Exams would likely be
                deviation from the ‘standard’ qualification path. The official
                rules of the reciprocity agreement have not been disclosed, but
                after talking to an NCARB representative this was the conclusion
                that was drawn. It is also worth noting that there is a clause
                mandating that the reciprocity agreement be re-evaluated 3-years
                after the agreement officially goes into effect. So yes, the
                terms of the agreement could change in the future. <br />
                NCARB defined Standard Path <br />
                Source: NCARB Foreign Architects: Application Process <br />
                So, if your goal is to ultimately be a licensed architect, there
                is currently little guarantee unless you fully commit to the US
                or the UK ‘standard’ path. Additionally, it is currently noted
                that each U.S. jurisdiction must individually determine if they
                will accept the Mutual Recognition Agreement. So whilst getting
                licensed in the UK will gives you reciprocity rights to the
                select number of US jurisdictions that accept the mutual
                recognition agreement, getting licensed in the US will grant to
                reciprocity rights to the whole of the UK in addition to New
                Zealand, Australia, Canada, and Mexico where reciprocity
                agreement are already in-place. Lastly, do considering the UK no
                longer gives you the advantage of the EU. Following Brexit in
                2020, if you are a licensed architect in the UK, you can
                practice in the UK.
              </p>

              <h3>Prepare Yourself for More Self-guided Education</h3>
              <p>
                If the practicality and nuances of licensure don’t bother you
                and you are sold on completing your Masters in Architecture in
                the UK, then I wanted to provide one more bit of helpful advice
                - come prepared to pave your own educational path. I can’t speak
                to every Masters in Architecture program in the UK, however this
                was the lesson I learned from my first term at the Bartlett. Do
                note that after speaking to students at other Universities, this
                does seem to be an overarching theme in the UK. <br />
                The Educational curriculum in the UK and US has some notable
                differences. I discussed this with my studio tutors and it was
                acknowledged that the US has a much more ‘academic’ approach to
                the teaching of architecture than the UK. My experience in the
                US undergraduate architecture program was that there was more
                rigid structure in place in regards to project briefs, site,
                deliverables, etc. My experience in the UK graduate architecture
                program was a heavy emphasis on self-lead learning. This is not
                a grievance on the more open-ended architectural education in
                the UK, however it was a rather difficult adjustment for me
                given that I was not prepared for the format of teaching. I see
                the value of both educational models. The main take-away is that
                if you are going to the UK, especially the Bartlett, prepare for
                the self-led education model ahead of time. If I could have done
                my first term over again I would have come in prepared with a
                clear topic of interest that could be developed into a project
                throughout the year. Come prepared with an idea of your own
                design process. Having a clearly defined understanding of how
                you want to work through your topic of interest will do you a
                world of good. What I mean by this is having a base framework
                for how you plan to investigate to topic of interest. Do you
                want to make physical models or do you want to focus on a
                digital approach? Are you interested in a particular
                construction material or methodology? Etc. Just having a
                conception of these topics will put you in a much better
                position for a successful graduate experience. This is not to
                say that my peers all came in knowing exactly what they were
                interested in and exactly how they were going to develop their
                projects. Everyone comes in with varied backgrounds, skills,
                interests and tutors are there to help guide your project. My
                hope is to primarily vocalize that a level of self-determinism
                and self-guided interest will be expected of you and coming
                prepared for this will benefit you greatly.
